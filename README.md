# RealisticCarPhysicsBehavior
A project on research for achieving realistic car driving behavior with corresponding physics. Such as wheel friction, engine acceleration, engine transmission, engine weight/lugging, suspension, engine sound, etc.

Implemented in a simple game rules that is you run in a lap to test the car physics behavior. You can try the game from this GDrive link and feel free to check it :D
